So, back at it, we're going to not really switch gears, but we're going to take this.and we're going to change 2D to 3D, and we're going to see how that relates..And you're going to like it, because a lot of what you do in 2D has this little extension.in 3D, and it's not really any different, it's just that you have this third dimension..Now, if you didn't know this, a lot of our world sort of like takes place in 3D..Did you know that?.That's crazy..I know, right?.Well, which means that one plane really doesn't cut it..It would cut it if we were always just on a flat road driving a car..That would probably work for cars..But we have like planes, right, and we move, and we have particles that move about, and.we need to be able to describe them in 3-space, in 3D, in R3, all this stuff..So we need a new coordinate system..And here's how we do it..Please get this right..It's not hard, okay, but it's a little different..What we're going to do is, instead of just having our XY plane, we're still going to.have that, but what we're going to do is, instead of having our XY plane up here, we're.going to drop it so our plane falls down horizontal, and we get this different axis..So X, Y, Z, seems logical, let's put it in alphabetical order, and then we get this Z.axis going perpendicular to both the X and the Y..So X and Y are perpendicular, and Z's also, they're mutually perpendicular..That's a 3D coordinate system..So when you're drawing it, you still draw this, but please, please, it's not X and Y.anymore..This is not X and Y..The X is a little weird..The X is the one that comes out towards you..So the X is the one that does this..This right here is the X axis..This right here is the Y axis, and it has to be the Y..It's laying flat, and if you look down, it creates the XY plane for you like it normally.does..Do you guys see what I'm talking about?.It's the Z that shoots up..Please, please always write the three-plane coordinate system like this..Please do that..Now, we're going to identify a whole lot about this before we can move any further..The first one is, where are our positive numbers, and where are our negative numbers?.So here's where they are..The positive numbers for X are coming this way..So this is the positive X, and this would be the negative X..So here's like 1, 2, 3, 4, negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4..Where do you suppose the positive Y is, to the right or to the left?.Yeah, we don't want to switch everything around..The positive is to the right on the Y axis..So 1, 2, 3, 4, this is positive Y, and negative Y is over here..And the Z, the same concept..Positive Z is going to climb, negative Z is going to fall..We're getting our feel okay with that one so far..It's a little funky, right?.But I mean, it's not 2D anymore, so we have to have a way to represent three dimensions..This is the best we got..So this, by the way, is called the right-hand coordinate system..Here's why it's called the right-hand..If I put my hand out, where my fingers are going along the positive X, and if I correct.curl them towards the positive Y, my thumb is pointed up towards the positive Z..Do you see what I'm talking about?.I can't, if I put this part of my shoulder like that, I go positive X to negative Y..Well, that's pointed negative Z..Does that make sense to you?.That's what's called right-handed..So positive X to positive Y gives me positive Z..X to negative Y gives me negative Z..That's the notes you're right-handed..Right-handed would be when I went positive X to positive Y, it would be the other way..The Y would be shifted, and that would give you this..We're talking about right-handed three coordinate system..This is generally what people do..So do you feel comfortable about the positive and negative axes, yeah or no?.Could you identify the XY plane?.Could you show me with your hands how it goes?.Is it on the board?.Is this the XY plane?.How's the XY plane?.Yeah, that's right..It's this flat one that's kind of cutting into the board..How about the YZ plane?.What's the YZ plane?.Is the YZ plane cutting into the board, or is the YZ plane on the board?.YZ plane is the board..The XZ plane is the one that's going into the board this way..I'd know if you're okay with the planes..All right, fantastic..Now, points..Points can't be X and Y anymore..So, hey, plot the point 2, 3..You're going to go, wait a minute..2, 3, where's....Okay, 2 would be X and 3 would be Y..Where's that going to be, though?.Because I need that third thing now..R2, so like 2D, we just need two points..R3, you now need three..You need three values, three coordinates..So we now have X, Y, and Z..It's always alphabetical order..I've got to be honest with you,.so they're ordered triples, not ordered pairs..They're not the easiest thing in the world to plot here..They really aren't,.because it's weird to go outside of a plane..You know what I'm talking about?.You don't yet, but you will..It's weird to go outside of a plane,.so we're going to try just a couple.so you get the idea on it..I'm also going to talk to you.about something called, well, not quadrants..How many sections are there?.If I used my planes,.how many sections would I have?.There was four quadrants,.because I went 1, 2, 3, and 4, correct?.Now, each of those quadrants has a top and a bottom..Four quadrants, each of them has a top and a bottom..Eight..Eight octants..One, all positive..Two, three, and four,.so it models the quadrant system,.1, 2, 3, 4,.and then we drop down 5, 6, 7, and 8..So above quadrant 1, we have octant 1,.and below it, we have octant 5..Does that make sense to you?.And we go around like that..So let's try to plot just a couple of them..The first one, I want to plot kind of an easy one..Let's do 2, 0, and negative 3..Okay, everybody, quickly, really quickly,.what is the x-coordinate, please?.What is the y-coordinate?.What's the z-coordinate?.Here's how you do it..It's always that order..So from the origin, we have positive 2..That's here..Notice it's here..y is 0, so we don't go anywhere,.and then we drop down how much?.Negative 3..Okay, now, it's a little weird..Here's the best way that you can plot these things..It's gonna take some parallel lines..Here's how to draw it..For those of you who aren't artistic, I'm not either,.but if you've got, like, a ruler.and can make parallel lines, this is the best way..Check this out..So here's the 2..I'm gonna put, like, just a little temporary mark..Here's the 0..I'm not moving..Here's the negative 3 on the z-axis..Do you follow what I'm talking about?.From this point, you're gonna do two things..You're gonna draw parallel with the z-axis this way.and parallel with the x-axis this way,.and where they meet, that is where your point is..Watch..So I'm gonna draw parallel..That looks pretty close to parallel for me on the x-axis..Does that make sense to you?.It goes through the z-coordinate,.and then this, I'm gonna draw parallel to the z-axis..The intersection of those,.that right there is the point 2, 0, negative 3..It's floating in space..It is on the xz-plane.because the y-coordinate is settled..So it's right there on that plane..I don't know if you're okay with that one..You see how I'm talking about that little weird graph, right?.It's gonna take practice,.and there's no other way that I can tell you,.but it's gonna take practice..It's gonna take practice..Let me do one more with you,.and after that,.it really is just all about practice, okay?.Uh, let's do....How about 2, 3, 5?.2, 3, 4..Quickly, x-coordinate, please..y-coordinate?.z-coordinate..What octant will this be in?.I go out, right?.I go out on the x,.because it's positive..Then I go here,.and then I go up..That's it..That's floating....That's floating up here..That's, like, right here, okay?.So we're in octant number....That's where we're at..Let's try to graph it..So when you have these,.do the x and the y first..So what we're gonna do.is we're gonna use our parallel lines for....I'm trying to show this to you,.that way you can actually visualize these points..Here's how it works..Draw your parallel axes again..So from my 2 and from my 3,.I'm gonna draw parallel along the y..This is the hard one..It's the x-axis..Draw parallel, so it's like this..Draw parallel along the x..Do you see what I'm doing?.Parallel along the x.and parallel along the y?.I don't know if you see.what we're talking about..Hello, yes, no?.Okay, true or false?.The point is right there..True or false?.No, false, yeah..This is what we call a projection..If you were to look down upon the world.and the xy plane is floating,.the xy plane is flat,.the point is raised up here,.but it would look like it's right over that spot.on the xy plane..Does that make sense to you?.Like a bird's-eye view,.that's where it would show up..That would be the shadow.or the image or the projection..That's what's happening..Now, where is this point really, though?.Where is this point?.Is it up or is it down?.Up..How much is it up?.4..Ah..So from right here,.you can do this 2 ways..You can just take this amount.and go straight up parallel..That's typically how I would probably do it,.but you lose a little bit of measurement that way..So you go, okay, my hand's pretty big,.so there, there, right about there..That's where that is..But there's a slightly different way to do it..I'm going to show you that way as well..The other way that you do this.is you just, because if you don't know,.if you don't know where it's at,.you extend this up as far as you can.and you do this..This is a weirder way, but it's a little more accurate..Draw yourself that segment that intersects the origin.with the projection of your point..Are you following what I'm talking about?.I'm going to make it dotted here..Go up to the appropriate height..What's the appropriate height?.What's our Z here, appropriate height?.4..Here..Shift this up..In other words, make it parallel..And where that intersects,.that's where your point is in space..It gives you a decent visual representation.about where you....Can you guys see the 3-D representation.I'm trying to draw here?.So it's, it's not exactly down here..It's shifted up, but that gives you a good frame,.like, oh, this is weird,.because it's on a plane, right?.But I've got to show that it's not..So I show my parallel lines,.and that's a good way to do it..That's a, man, they take a while, right?.For you to do this..Head on if you're okay.with at least one of those ways of graphing this..Okay, perfect..What about this?.What if I said I want you to graph.x equals 2?.Could you do it?.What is x equals 2?.Lines would be in 2-D..What's a line in 3-D?.Plane?.What's a line that goes forever in....It's a plane..x equals 2..Lines now become planes..Circles become spheres, okay?.Functions become surfaces..So we're extending the dimension..So when I say x equals 2,.that x equals 2 says x equals 2.for everything..That's a plane..So the x equals 2 would cut.through the x-axis at 2.and go all the way this way..How about y, y equals 5?.If I did y equals 5,.what we'd do is we'd come over here to 5..We'd cut into the board.at 5. It wouldn't be like this..It wouldn't be like this because that would intersect..It would be just like that..x and z could be anything..It would cut right through y equals 5..Does that make sense?.Can you visualize z equals negative 2?.What plane would z equals negative 2.be parallel to?.It'd be like taking.an xy plane and dropping it two spots..That's what z equals negative 2 would be..Are you still with me?.Am I boring you to tears?.I hope I'm not. It's not super.difficult, but it's super new,.which can be difficult..The last thing I want to talk about before we take.just a short break..When we get an equation now.and when our equation is.in x's and y's.in 2D, we got lines and stuff,.right? And functions..But when we get x's and y's and z's.now, we now have the ability to shift.through space in the x direction.and the y direction and the z..We don't get lines necessarily..When we don't get planes necessarily,.we get these things called surfaces..We get weird stuff, and it's pretty cool..That's really the focus of this class..It's how we deal with the calculus.of surfaces and things.that are on surfaces and traveling through.surfaces, stuff like that..That's the majority of it..Then we talk about vector fields..That's later on..Fill out this stuff..Time to change our 2D stuff.into 3D stuff..You're going to find out that all the formulas.that we use for 3D coordinates.are based on 2D coordinates..They're very similar..For instance, our distance.formula. If you want to find.the distance between two points.and you had a 2D system,.this is the distance formula for 2D..x2 minus x1 squared.is how we find magnitude..If we want the third,.it's literally just adding.on the z2.minus z1 squared..That's all there is to it, which means.this. Now think about this.in the future..When we do vectors,.notice how the magnitude.if the distance formula is basically.the same for 2D and 3D,.then the magnitude is basically.the same for 2D and 3D..Does that make sense to you?.We're going to get that from here..Just a little short example..Do you know what an isosceles triangle.is? Do you know what that means?.It has.two.sides that are exactly the same..If I wanted two sides.that had the same length and I had.three points, I could find the distance.between every set of two points.and check those distances. The idea.behind doing problems like this is.try to think back to the geometric aspect of it.and do the distance formula..Do the midpoint formula. Do what it takes to compare.these sides or something..If we found the distance from A.to B,.the distance from B to C,.and the distance from.A to C, that would represent.the three sides of our triangle. Can you guys do that?.Could you find the distance between.A and B and A and C.and B and C? Could you do that?.Let's try it. Let's try it real quick..I'll do the first one for you.just to show you how fast this.really goes, but the idea is.you should be able to use the formulas..Then if I ask you for something like, oh,.hey, is it a right triangle?.Well, if you can find the distances and they fit.the Pythagorean theorem,.then you'd have a right triangle..Does that make sense? Were you listening?.I'll say it again later then..You're probably working..The way it works, just take the.X2 minus X1 squared..X2 minus Y1 squared..Z2 minus Z1 squared..From A to B, we have.1 squared.plus 0 squared.plus 5 squared..This is going to give you the square root of 26..Can you verify that for me?.Square root of 26..Do you see where the numbers came from?.I don't want to blow past you..I don't want to go too fast for you..Are you seriously with me?.How about the BC?.Which number I would square?.Do we have.to do negative 1.when we're squaring stuff?.Because if I went BC, it'd really be 3 minus.4. Does it matter?.I could go CB..It doesn't really matter..If I wanted to do here to here, that's fine too..That's probably a little bit easier even..We'd have 1 squared.plus 3 squared plus, what's the next one?.16..9..1..How much?.True or false? It's at least isosceles..Why?.Because I have two sides that are the same.so it fits isosceles..The third side, I think we can square root of 10..We can do it AC.is 0 squared plus.3 squared.plus negative 1 squared..You can just do 1 squared..Square root of 10..A lot of textbooks ask for.is it isosceles? Can you verify it is isosceles?.Yes or no?.Is it a right triangle?.Then you do things like.do two of these sides squared.equal the hypotenuse squared? It doesn't here..No, it's not a right triangle..You talk about Pythagorean Theorem..If I said are they collinear?.Do two of them.add up to a third one?.That would be collinear..If two lengths add up to the third one, you don't have a triangle anymore..You have a non-triangle..They just line on top of each other..Does that make sense to you?.That's the idea, but it uses some of this stuff..Midpoint formula is just.an extrapolation as well..If I want to find the midpoint,.this is midpoint for.a 2D system..It's just averaging the coordinates..That's exactly.the same thing we do.for 3D..Now, we talked about it.briefly, but.we're not going to have a whole lot of circles.anymore. If we take the idea.of circle from 2D, what shape do we get.for 3D?.Circles now change to.how about.spheres?.What's really awesome about spheres is everything you learn.from circles pretty much works for spheres..Just like distance,.just like midpoint, we just have this.little addition, this little concept added on.to it. This right here,.please watch carefully, this right here would.be the equation for a circle..This is it. All we.have to do is add to it.the third dimension..I forget what I use..The only thing that you really have to get down.for the center of a circle.is always.the opposite of whatever that sign.is. If this is a.minus, the center.is a positive number. That's a plus..The center has a negative number in it. Does that.make sense to you? It's as simple as I can make it..Our center for a sphere is very.much like the center of a circle. We have H,.we have K, and we're going to have L..The radius actually still works.also. The radius is.just R,.which is nice..I want to click head on if.you're okay with this so far..Are you sure? Do you want to try.an example here real fast?.Let's go ahead.and I'm going to give you.a pretty nasty equation.and we're going to see what this thing is..Wow, that's a lot..That's a lot of stuff..Number one, anybody want to do that?.You're like, no..No, dude,.that's a lot..That's a thing. Here's how to.cope with a lot of this stuff..Number one, you're.going to get pretty used to looking at.an equation and giving me.a surface that's associated with it..Trust me, you're going to get very good at that.because a lot of things that we do.in here deal with these surfaces..A lot of quadric surfaces.that we have..So,.we'll talk about this thing.but here's some things that you can.try to see.if this thing is a circle.or a sphere or a cylinder..Here's one of the concepts. Number one thing,.if you have square.square square, same number here,.no other squares,.probably a sphere..It's probably going to be some sort of a sphere.or at least a quadric surface..In that case, when you have.square square square, same exact number,.let's go ahead and try to group our variables..Let's try to get no.coefficients in front of those squares.because we're going to try to complete the square..That's the idea here..Let's try to get a look at it..Let's move our constant..We're going to also group our.variables. So when I talk about that,.I mean, let's put our x's together..Let's put our y's together..Let's put our z's.together..And let's get our constant off to the other side..Now, if you remember completing the square,.I know this is kind of how I do review.with you. I do problems that.deal with some stuff that you should know. It's going to give you a little.chance at review..If you know how to complete.the square, that's awesome. If you don't know how to.complete the square, the idea is.you can't have numbers here..This is why we look for the.coefficients of our square terms to be the same.because we're going to divide those out..So we're going to divide everything by two..I give you a nice problem. Divide everything.by two, and I also mean this side..So go ahead and do that now..I want to know if you made it that far. Give me a quick hand now.if you made it that far. Cool..Do you remember how to complete the square?.I'm going to do one of them.and you're responsible for the other ones. Here's how.you complete the square. What happens.you take.this number,.you take half of it,.and you square it. So when I take half.this number, it's negative 3 halves..I square that, I get.positive 9 fourths..That's what gets added.to both.sides.of your equation. It's got to be both sides.or else you don't have an equation..It's got to be both sides. Let's do one more..This one. Let's half.that number. Everybody, quickly please, let's half that number..No, it's not 1..It's negative 1. The sign matters.for the next thing we do..When you square it, what's the square of negative 1?.It's always.adding. Now we're going to add it to.both sides..Can you do the last one please?.What's half that number?.Come on, I can't hear you..What's 1 half.squared?.You're adding 1 fourth..Remember the.advice about a fraction calculator?.Remember that?.I guess.it's not that hard, but.it sucks to have to think about all that stuff.right there..How much is it?.4, right?.So it's.10 fourths.that's 5 halves.so 6.3 plus 1, that's 4..Did you guys get 4?.Fraction..Calculator. Do it, man..So all this junk.adds to 4..This side..Here's how you finish completing the square.if you don't know how to do it..It's really easy. You just have to remember.the numbers that you've got before you squared them.and the factor is right there..Here's how it works..This part's going to give you something..This part's going to give you something..This part's going to give you something..This is x. Do you remember what half that number was?.Including the sign?.And.square..Do you remember what half that number was?.Come on, folks..Play along with me..Minus 1 and.you square. This is no fun..You can play tennis by yourself..Come on..It's like walls right now..What's half of this?.What's half of that number?.So z plus.square..I want to show if you guys feel okay with that idea..I know it's just algebra, but the.just algebra part can be really hard..So that's usually what people.end up screwing up in calculus is the algebra.and the graphing, doing this.junk. Hey!.Is that a sphere? Can you recognize.the formula for a sphere?.Right now, I want you to write.Can you write the center.and the radius.for that sphere? On your own,.write the center and the radius.for that sphere, please..You don't have to say it out loud..True or false?.The first coordinate, the x coordinate.of our center is going to be negative..True or false? It's going to be negative..Good. What's the x coordinate for our center?.It's always the opposite.of that sign that's in there..That's the way the shifting works inside.parentheses. That's like a translation that you learn.from intermediate algebra..What's the y coordinate?.What's the z coordinate?.You caught it. Perfect..Radius. Come on, radius..4, 16, 2. What is it?.Could you graph it if I asked you to?.Yeah, but not fine..Because even just finding the center itself.is going to suck. And then doing the radius.that's not going to be so much fun..Yeah, but you can think about.where it's at..This last one that we're going to do.just a little practice example to see.how this stuff works..I'm going to mostly just give you the answers here..I just want you thinking through it right now..Let's think through this..Imagine a sphere.and at opposite ends of the diameter.I've got these two points A and B..Don't say it out loud. I want you to think about it..What would you do.I just spit. That was nasty..Sorry. Caught that on HD camera..I'm not going to edit it either..Enjoy that..I lost a train of thought now..Oh yeah, right..These two points are opposite ends of a diameter..Diameters always.go through where?.Diameters over the radius..Diameters go through the.center. So if I give you.two points that say they're the opposite ends of a diameter.how would you find the center?.Halfway through..Oh, did we have a formula for the halfway through?.Not distance..And the midpoint..If you wanted to find out where.the center is.you should do.this on your own..When you go home to see if you get the same thing.the center would be.at the midpoint.of A and B..I've already done it..The midpoint would be.it's really just averaging them..It's not that hard..Five halves?.Negative one half?.Five halves..Did you catch how to do the midpoint really fast?.Do you understand that the center would be the midpoint.if that's the ends of a diameter?.Again, putting this stuff in your head..It's weird, but this is a lot of geometry..A lot. You've got to picture it..Oh goodness..Could you tell me what the radius.could you tell me how to find.the radius? Could you tell me that?.I know that radius.is half the diameter. That's very good..What's the diameter?.It's a segment from here to here..How would you find.the distance?.If you did the distance.and then did the distance between here.and here would sure give you the distance of the diameter..How do you find the radius?.So this would be.one half the distance.from A to B..The distance from A to B.is, let's see, one squared.five squared.three squared.that's 35.in a square root.and then take half.that right there would be the radius..Square root.of 35 over 2..I did it fast. You need to do it on your own..Just go through it one time..Do the distance formula yourself.take half of it to understand.that the radius is going to be that square root of 35 over 2..Are you guys okay with what I'm talking about?.How about this one?.If I give you the center.which is what this is.and the radius.can you write for me the equation of the circle?.Try it..We just went from here to here..Try going from here to here on that example..I'll give you about a minute. Go for it..Write the equation for that..Then we get the good stuff..We get the favorite part of my day right here..It wasn't when I got kicked out of my own classroom..It wasn't when.I ran my fifth wheel into an overpass..It wasn't that..That wasn't today though..It's still on my mind though. I'm still heartbroken..It happened for real. It sucked..It's funny..You can talk about vectors in like half a second.when you finish that..The way that.the equation, I think I said circle.or sphere if I misspoke..The equation of the sphere.always looks like this..It always looks like that..All you have to be able to do is figure out what the center is.put it in the right spots..It's kind of nice though because.x coordinates match up with x variables.y coordinates, y variables..It's the same stuff..The radius doesn't change either..You've got to put the right things in the right spots.with the right signs..Am I going to have a plus or a minus right here?.Plus..If I leave that square there.yes.and then if I actually go ahead.and square it, if you gave me this.then that's.the correct answer also..You guys with me?.Hard? Medium?.Weird?.Different right? It's different..You can wrap your head around it. You will. Trust me. You will..Now we're going to talk about vectors in three spaces..This is where we make our money..This is great. This is not.calculus-y stuff. We use it to get.our head around what 3D is..This stuff, this vectors.in R3, in three space, in three dimensions.this is where we're going to make our money in our class..This is.what we deal with calculus with.is a lot of vectors..We're going to talk about vectors..The good part.is that all the stuff I'm teaching.right now, I'm really not teaching you..We're just taking, just like.this was an extension of 2D.this is an extension of 2D..It's virtually the same..We're going to talk about position vectors..We're going to figure out what magnitude is..We're going to talk about unit vectors. We're going to talk about parallel..We're not going to have slope anymore.because slope doesn't work anymore..We're not just on a plane..We're crossing through planes and doing stuff like that..It doesn't work..It actually makes our lives easier..There's now only going to be one way to check for parallel vectors..If you think of anything.it's an extension of 2D vectors.that we'll talk about right now..The first thing we need to know.is how we define position vectors..You know it, right?.What's a position vector?.What's it do?.Where does it start at?.It starts at the origin..0, 0, 0..Where does it go?.Say it louder..It goes to a point..A position vector is this vector.that has its initial point at the origin.and it points to a point..That point it points to.are literally the components.of that position vector..It's very convenient..It just says, hey, I'm going from the origin to here..I'm pointing there..Same thing in 2D..We just now have it for 3D..The thing I need you to know is a position vector.is the same..It starts, it initiates at the origin.or you understand the concept here?.It looks identical.that would be old school.position vector..Now here's a new one..We just add a z component..Now instead of going on the xy plane.we now have xy motion and z motion.gives us a 3D vector..Can you extrapolate from this.and tell me maybe.a different way to write.without the brackets..What do you think?.What would the first thing be?.The first thing would not be a line..The first thing would be a number..It would be the same exact number.but then what this is.it's just different notation. This is the vector.that's pointing to this point..Do you get the point?.This one says that hey, you're going.this scalar times.that i direction..The vector in the x direction..Then you're taking this.in the j direction.and you're taking.what letter do you want to use now?.You guys are geniuses, all of you..We'll do k..Exactly right..And what these are.are the x and the y.and the z components..x and the y and the z components..It's the same thing.as 2D, we just have that extra little thing..Now.if you remember talking about.the distance formula.the distance formula was really.similar to 2D.which means the distance formula for vectors.what do you call the distance formula.for the distance of a vector?.The magnitudes would be virtually identical..Which is really nice..So if we wanted to find the magnitude.of a vector.what do you think you're going to do?.Come on, what do you think you're going to do?.Square root of.square root.add them.come on do it.square root.it's like.infiltrate the dealers, find the supplies.well maybe not that.it's pretty close, it's like three things.you're going to square them.we're going to square them.we're going to add them.square root.it is the distance formula.it just so happens that because.a position vector starts at 0, 0.we don't have that other.this is all 0, 0.so we're just squaring these numbers.adding them and square rooting.that's how it works.ok, the other two things.and then literally all we have to do is practice.are these final two statements.which you already basically know.the first one.in order to do that we have to restrict our direction.and that's called directional derivatives.and we're not there, that's like chapter 13.so because we don't have a slope.concept right now.we can't talk about vectors being parallel.with their slopes.the only other thing was the second way.to do it from 2D.do you remember it?.that was a while back.but do you remember it?.say what?.same unit vector or maybe.slightly easier, remember the thing we did.right down here where you did the whole factoring thing.come on, put it together.they were.those things that we were multiplying vectors by.what are those called? scalar.that's how you tell.that's how you tell.we use the unit vector.please listen carefully, there's a slight difference.we use the unit vector not to.prove that vectors are parallel.because that's pretty hard.we use the unit vector to give us a.parallel vector to something else.that's what we use it for, does that make sense?.shrink it and then grow it.that's what the unit vector does, shrinks it.and then we multiply to grow it.how we check whether vectors are parallel.is literally just if they're scalar multiples.that's the only way that we really do in 3D.so vectors are.write that down please, vectors are parallel.if they are scalar multiples.if you want the real math-y.way to write it.a is parallel to b.if a.is a scalar.times b, that's the way.that this looks, and we have done this already.do you remember doing it?.we took b, we factored out a number, we said.it's that number times a.or vice versa, we've already done it.we're going to do that a couple more times in 3D.but that's basically it.is that the math way of spelling it?.it is the math way of spelling it.if and only if?.it's an if and only if.it's a biconditional.I'm not that bad at spelling.I know words good.but yeah, this is biconditional.it means that this is necessary.and sufficient to prove this.this is good enough for this, this is good enough for that.so parallel means this is happening.this means parallel is happening.can we practice?.you literally have enough.I think, honestly.all of the rest of this is extra.because it's just extrapolation.but we're going to practice anyway.what we're going to do is.maybe like 5 examples.we are going to move fast through them.because they're very similar to 2D.are you guys ok with that?.first thing I want to do.is we're going to talk about parallel.even though we just discussed it.let's see how to prove it.let's prove that vector A.is parallel to vector B.when B is the thing that I just gave you.let's prove that.come on, reiterate it for me.I know we just talked about it.but I want you to get in your head here.how would you show vectors are parallel?.what do they need to be in order to be parallel?.scalar.that's the easiest way.scalar multiples.it's a unit vector but it's too much work.that's a lot of work.we typically do that to say.hey I want a vector parallel to another one.then you've got to find the unit vector.but if I just want to say.if they're parallel.I've given you 2 of them.well let's factor.factoring is finding a scalar multiple.so let's factor.can you factor that one?.are these 2 vectors parallel?.are you getting good at finding.the notation here and here.and translating back and forth.if you're not and I give you a different notation.I'm going to do that a lot to get you used to it.if you're not then you go one step.further and you go okay this is.I minus 2J.plus 5K.and this is 3.oh that's exactly what that is.that's 3 times A.and then we go oh this is what I'm.talking about if one vector is a.scalar times another.they are parallel.with me?.yes no maybe.easy medium hard.kind of easy to do right you just got to remember that this is.what it is and that's one of the hard parts.is remembering all this stuff how to do it.tell you what why don't you try this on your own.here's number 2 let's let B.be this vector.I think this one's easier actually.you can almost see it.did you find out whether those 2.vectors are parallel or not?.don't let fractions concern you.if you have a common denominator.that's always a good thing to factor out.almost always a good thing to factor out.so if we have these thirds.let's factor out the one third.then we get what do you get?.I minus 2J.thanks for.whispering I still heard you.because I get good ears but yeah alright.if I factor the one third.we get one I.minus 2J plus 5K.if you factor something.and you get your vector.you're checking for in there.and you have a number times that.you have something that is parallel.these 2 things are also parallel.show of hands if you're okay with what that is.so this is also parallel.this we're just going to work with.what I want to do here is 3 things.I'm going to make you do it on your own right now.because I think that you can.so I want to spend about 2 or 3 minutes.I'm going to give you that time.what I want you to do is find 3 things.find 2A minus 3B.hey can you take what you learned.in 2D vectors and apply it to that.we can still multiply scalars.by things we literally just did it.kind of undid multiplying.we can add and subtract vectors the same exact way.so I want you to figure out what this is.I want you to figure out what this is.and what this is.do you know what to do in each case?.nod your head if you do know what to do.in each case.good okay go for it.can you remind me to ask you a question.about this one when we're done.because I'll forget.okay so we got like 3 more examples.and then we're done with this section.we should hammer through it.so if you can hang on for me.for 3 more examples.were you able to do.did I give you enough time for this?.for the first one at least.were you able to do all of them?.okay let me give you another minute or so.I want you to actually do them all on your own.I do want you to hang out with me.until the last example.on this because it's going to be a.reiteration of the last example.from section.11.1.and I want you guys to really.hammer it into your head on how to do this.until the last one.you know a lot of times.when we're switching formats or frankly just having.a lot of small stuff.going on in our head.I don't know that I do that all at once in my head.if you can't great that's fine I don't think I would though.because I'd be like man that's a lot.going on I've got two different formats.so pick one that works for you I don't care.I'll accept both answers.I's J's K's or brackets I don't care.but be able to do it.so for me personally I'd be like okay.let's do 2A and see what it is.I know it's negative 2I plus 4J.that's my 2A right here does that make sense.then I'm going to do a minus sign.because I'm subtracting and I'm just going to do 3B.well that's 6.well you can do the bracket notation if you buy it.but that's 6I.that's 9J and that's minus 3K.I think it's okay with that first one.if you did brackets that is absolutely fine.I don't care.no but we've at least broken it down.so let's go ahead and finish up the last.this would be.how much.could you go back to that.if you want to or negative 8I.it doesn't matter whatever you want to do.how about the J's.what about the K's.if you have.negative 8I minus 5J.plus 3K that's.exactly right also.is this straight forward enough for y'all.what's the first course.of action on this.multiply what.3A.for us this is.this is literally just a.2D vector so when I'm finding this.this was done in the last section we can do it here.but it's not going to be that hard.so we're going to have.negative 3I.plus 6J.and then we're going to find the magnitude of that.what is that.square root 45.you're going to see a lot of.not square root 45 in the back of the book.what are you going to see.you're going to see 3 root 5 because you're going to simplify that.are you making the little.mistakes yet.are you making the little mistakes multiplying by the wrong number.it happens to me a lot.I'll be honest I do it all the time.so that's why take your time on.these things.last one.we find the magnitude of.oh goodness.negative 4.do you want to leave the vector.bracket notation that's fine.negative 6 and positive 2.can you check.my work on that one did you all get the same thing.and then finding the magnitude.I'm not going to do the work for you what's the magnitude of this.how much.root 56.2 root 14.2 root 14.this 4 divides that number.I think I asked you to remind me about something.here's my question.if I took that negative away.would it affect that answer.all the negative does is reverse.that direction does not affect.the magnitude that's kind of interesting right.it's almost like the absolute value.because it's a distance it's a magnitude it's a length.doesn't matter okay the last 3 examples.we got these 2 and one more.and then we're going to call it good.can you find and they're fast.so can you find a position vector.between 2 points it's done exactly.the same way that we found position vectors.in section 11.1.how did we do it.I like the ch-ch-ch-ch but what's it mean.come on left siders well how do you do it.how do you do it.how would you find a vector going from here to here.and have a position vector do you remember.if you do awesome.if you're just kind of staring me with fish eyes.like oh crap don't make eye contact.I'm not going to call on you.if we wanted that vector.so this thing equals vector V.you just subtract.just like in 2D it works.in 3D so to find a position.vector we do.I'm going to write it all out for you.1-2.4-1.5-0 position vectors.no matter whether you're in 2D or 3D are just.about subtracting.the coordinates of.those points and then we automatically.get a position vector is that clear enough for you guys.subtract the coordinates of the points.so here our vector would be.negative 1.3 5.could you write that as a standard.basis vector do you know what that means.I'm going to ask you to write it as a standard basis vector.could you do it yes.you don't need to do it just tell me how would it be written.negative i.3j.plus 5k.yep that would be the other way to write that.still ok.could you find a.could you find a.unit vector for this if I asked you to.that's a big deal in this class.we're going to find a ton of unit vectors.can you find a unit vector here.if I asked you to explain to me.right side only how.do you find a unit vector.unit vector equals the.vector number on top over the.absolute value of the vector.can you say that one more time.but without using absolute value.starts with m.right starts with m rinds with.magnitude.good.that was a joke not a funny one obviously.goodness.unit vectors are found the exact same way.no matter what you were doing.you take the original vector which I've given you.divide by the magnitude go ahead and try that now.divide by the magnitude.that's how unit vectors.always work look if this is the length.as you're working through it.if that's the length of your vector.and you divide your vector by the length.you're basically taking length divided by length.the same length and getting one.that's the definition of a unit vector.and I'll say this.when I say unit vector what are we talking about.it doesn't have a length of one.but what are we talking about.the direction we're finding the direction that this vector.is headed in that's what we're doing.okay let's focus on this.for half a second and we'll do that.example and we'll end our section here today.so our unit vector.you've got this negative i.plus three j.minus k do I care.if you switch that to the bracket notation.if you prefer that do it.but I do want to divide it by.man you've got to know how to find magnitude.at this point you've got to know what that means.and I think that you all do.so let's find the magnitude explain to me in the simplest way.ever how you find the magnitude of a vector.what's the three things you do.square root.all I heard was blah blah blah.but I'm imagining.that you said square root.that's what you do.so underneath this square root we're going to take.do the negatives matter.it's just one.I hope I did it right.I end up squaring these in my head.pretty much all the time.because I go okay negative one it's one squared is one.one squared is nine one squared is one.I do that in my head a lot.okay.this is negative i plus three j.minus k.all over the square root of 11.this is not.how you leave a unit vector.you choose one of two ways.from here on out.one way is kind of sucky.one way is a lot nicer.you're going to see both ways.one way that you can write the unit vector.rationalize and distribute.all of this stuff.and you get negative square root of 11 over 11 i.plus three.root 11 over 11 j.minus square root.of 11 over 11.k.that's kind of the messy way to do it.but it's the literal vector.so there's pros and cons.this is the vector.it gives you each direction independently.and that's kind of nice.the other way to do it.take this which is the.thing that's taking your.vector and shrinking it to a unit vector.here take the thing.rationalize it.but leave it out in front of your vector.and this is kind of more.an interpretive.I almost said interpretive dance.it's like an interpretive dance of what's happening to the vector.what's happening is you're taking this.vector and multiplying it by something.that's shrinking it.to something that's less than one.it's shortening that vector.and that's kind of an interpretive way of looking at that.that's what's happening.show of hands if you understand what's happening.good for you guys, it's fantastic.it doesn't matter if we leave that at like negative one.no.does not matter.either way.okay last one.I want you to recognize that this example.is really similar to the last thing that we did in section 11.1.remember that.I want you to find a vector.that is parallel.actually I messed it up.kind of gave away the punchline here.let's look at it.I'm going to answer questions at the very end here.but let's focus up.I want you to find me a vector.that has a.what's that mean?.or how do you think about magnitude?.length of two.and.v has the.right now.same direction.means.univector.same direction means same univector.this is when you have to find the univector.you see what I'm talking about.if you're just checking whether two vectors are parallel.if I'm saying.I want you to create from scratch.a vector.that is parallel, same direction.that's when you take this vector.you shrink it.univector.and then you grow it by multiplying.it's basically this.but then at the very end we're going to go.hey you know what.you remember that one time when we took a magnitude.and we totally multiplied it by a univector.that's what we're doing.so basically when I ask you this problem on a test.and I say I want you to find me a vector.with that magnitude in the same direction as this.what I'm asking you to do is.find the direction.that's why I'm having you think.same direction, same univector.I want you to find me the univector.and then give it the appropriate.magnitude, that's what I want.find me the univector.give it the appropriate magnitude.direction, magnitude, that's what a vector is.it's a direction times a magnitude.I'm going to give you a minute, I'm going to wrap it up here really fast.and then we're going to call it good.for this section.question.what do we do first?.shorten it.univector it.that's the thing.how do you find a univector?.that's like the big thing, you've got to find magnitude.so when we do magnitude.and our univector.is equal to.vector.man.goodness, you know what I see on tests a lot.I saw a lot.people take this and multiply by 2.and go yay.you have found a.parallel vector, it's the same direction.but it does not have the same magnitude.does that make sense?.so we're going to run through it quick but the idea is.you've got to shorten it first, you've got to find the univector.then multiply by the 2.so in our case we've got our I minus 2J.plus 3K.divided by.let's see 9, square root of 14.the magnitude.of W is a square root of 14.how I would write it.man, I seriously would do this.I like this because it saves me.a lot of headache and a lot of writing the same.thing three times.but you can do whatever you want.you can distribute that and that's fine also.what is this.what is it?.it's a univector, what's a univector mean?.come on, univector means.direction.that's what it means.this is the direction.that I want, does that make sense?.but it has a magnitude of what?.no.this has a magnitude of.1, because it's a univector.let's give it the appropriate magnitude.so right now we take our.vector, ok, the appropriate.magnitude that I want was what.please?.the magnitude, sorry, the univector.that I have was.this one.this is another good reason why you leave this hanging out front.why?.a lot of these are simplified.and if you have to then you can redistribute it.if you absolutely need to.but the vector that we're talking about.the vector that ends our section today.which is nice, don't do that.I'll make little mistakes now.goodness, that's money.you do that and you get 10 points on the test.pretty easy, is it hard to do?.do you have to understand every little thing.about it to get it right though?.you absolutely do and there's a lot to it.that's where we're going to end our section tod
